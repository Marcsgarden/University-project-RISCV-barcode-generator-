# Barcode Generator in Assembly (RISC-V)

![Barcode Example](https://your-image-link-here.com) <!-- Optional: Add a sample barcode image -->

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **barcode generator written in RISC-V assembly**. It takes user input and encodes it into a barcode format, saving it as a `.bmp` image file.

## 🚀 Features

- Reads user input as a string.
- Converts the input into a barcode representation.
- Renders the barcode and saves it as a `barcode.bmp` file.
- Implements bitmap manipulation in assembly.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **RISC-V Assembly**
- **BMP File Format**
- **Low-Level Memory Management**

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. **Assemble the code** using a RISC-V assembler such as `rars`:
   ```sh
   java -jar rars.jar barcode_generator.s
